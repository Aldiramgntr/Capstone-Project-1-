Purwadhika Job Connector - Data Science & Machine Learning Online Program

As part of my journey in the Data Science & Machine Learning program at Purwadhika, I developed an Employee Data Management System, a mini-application designed to handle employee records efficiently. This project showcases full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities with intuitive, user-friendly features. 

Below are the core components:

1. Employee Management Dashboard
- View All Employees: Displays the complete list of employees with relevant details.

2. Add New Employee
- A process for adding new employees to the system by entering essential information, such as name, employees ID number, and department. 

3. Update Employee Information
- This feature enables the modification of existing employee details such as ID name, employees ID number, and department.

4. Delete Employee Records
- A secure function that allows the removal of employee records from the system where users able to Delete Employee Records by Name or Employee ID number
  
I've also created a main menu that continues until the user selects the exit option, and a sub-menu for the Update Employee System. And a system that displays an error message if the input is invalid.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in building  applications using key programming techniques like data types, loops, conditionals, and functions. The system is designed to be practical use for employee management system.
